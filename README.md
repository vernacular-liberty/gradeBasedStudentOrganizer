# Grade Based Student Organizer
##Guide to Implementation
I constructed a generic Binary Tree that takes in a generic Node which I used to sort students based
on different fields of data. The classroom class organizes and saves the student objects into different binary trees and lists constructed by traversing those trees. There are two tree classes that extend the generic binary tree. BinSearchTreeNames.java uses the full name of the student as the data field and constructs an alphabetized binary tree through a binary tree search algorithm. The other, 
BinSearchTreeGrades.java uses an arraylist of Students as the node's data field and constructs a binary search tree. Using the arraylist allows us to add multiple Students with the same grade to the tree.

##Instructions

##To Do
- Add more fields to the student and manipulate them to serve the classrooms purpose.
